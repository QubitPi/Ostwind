[JSON-API](https://jsonapi.org) is a specification for building REST APIs for CRUID (create, read, update, and delete)
operations.

Similar to GraphQL, it allows the client to control what is returned in the response payload. Unlike GraphQL, the
JSON-API spells out hot to perform file operations instead of file metadata operations.

JSON-API has no standardized schema introspection. However, Ostwind adds this capability to file service by exporting an
[Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org) document (formerly known as [Swagger](https://swagger.io)). The
[json-api specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/) is the best reference for understanding JSON-API.
The following sections describe commonly used JSON-API features as well as Ostwind additions for filtering and swagger.

Hierarchical URLs
-----------------

Ostwind generally follows the [JSON-API recommendations](http://jsonapi.org/recommendations/) for URL design.

Ostwind currently requires all files to be addressed by ID within a URL parameter. For example, downloading a file with
an ID of 1 must be fully qualified by ID: `/file/download?fileId=1`

File Identifiers
----------------

Ostwind supports two mechanisms by which a newly uploaded file is assigned an ID:

1. The file is assigned by a [fixed-length ID][FileNameAndUploadedTimeBasedIdGenerator] and saved in the data store.
2. The application provides an ID which is generated by a custom [FileIdGenerator] implementation  by the application

In order to replace the [default file ID generator][FileNameAndUploadedTimeBasedIdGenerator], the custom implementation
must be bound explicitly through [BinderFactory][AbstractBinderFactory]. For example, when application implements a
generator called 'MyIdGenerator', it will load via

```java
@Override
protected Class<? extends FileIdGenerator> buildFileIdGenerator() {
    return MyIdGenerator.class
}
```
