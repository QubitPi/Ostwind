Athena meta store offers a GraphQL query language for file metadata API. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a
runtime for fulfilling those queries with our existing file metadata. Athena provides a complete and understandable 
description of the file data in its API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
